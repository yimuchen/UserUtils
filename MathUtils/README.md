# `MathUtils` package

This package is a contains classes to help with mathematical operations. Especially to help with calculations of measurements with uncertainty

## Known issues.

 - [ ] Minos uncertainty for a binomial measurement fails when the inputs is an
   all-pass and all-fail. (special cases needed)
 - [ ] Minos uncertainties for a binomial measurement fails when input has a
   numerator much smaller than the denominator, ex (0.01/10000)
