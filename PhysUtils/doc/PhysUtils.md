@brief PhysUtils

This is a collection of functions for operating the physics objects defined the 
CMSSW framework. This includes topology crawling, trigger matching, and extended
variables whose calculation is well documented, but CMSSW doesn't provide a 
direct method.
Since this relies on the physics objects defined in CMSSW, this package 
would not have its standalone version.
